# Quick Analysis Example
Early version of quick analysis app for analyzing battery cycling information.  


##Features
Everything is live-updating and interactive, so you can change anything at any time!

###Import
* Import heterogenous datasets from a variety of file types, formats, and structures
* Automatically identify and standardize time stamps across data sources
* Merge dissimilar column names using an interactive heatmap and diagnostic tools
* Datasets are automatically sorted by type and ID, and can be easily changed at any time
* Label table supports autofill, copy-paste, and drag-and-drop to improve ease of use
* Customize charting colors at any time using hex colors or named colors (default colorset is monospaced pastel)

###Explore
* Continuous variable analysis allows you to explore and compare time series
* Discrete variable analysis allows you to reduce cycling data by finding intersections of x-y pairs
* Filter down your dataset by any combination of variables to help find what you're looking for
* Toggle calculation of the average and standard error of the mean by type
* Check out a derived version of the cycling protocol and investigate testing differences between batteries
* Choose between a line graph and a bar graph depending on the size of your dataset
* Work through raw data in the table tab using the filtering tools, or download as a csv for use in an external application
* Long-form data is best suited for relational computations, such as PivotTable in Excel
* Wide-form data is best suited for ordinal computations, such as making gaphs in Excel

###Share
* Choose between three different themes for your high resolution downloadable graph
* Move the legend around to a non-intrusive location
* Change the font size to improve readability
* Optionally add a chart title
* Select a custom x and y range for graphing
* Add a horizontal line to call attention to a critical event

##Coming soon
* A better name
* Download interactive widgets as html files for easy sharing
* Support for merging datasets automatically
* Add annotations to graphs
* Recommendations tab to detect patterns and exceptions within the dataset
* Always improving the underlying decision algorithms
